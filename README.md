### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋  

My name is Tomasz Targiel and I am currently studying Applied Computer Science at the University of Wrocław and Cybersecurity at Saarland University.  

As of late, I am working on my Engineering Thesis 🔭 - __"Analysis of insufficient encryption of wireless keyboard communications: A case study"__, with practical example of both capturing and decrypting the transmission packets using: _self-made software + Raspberry Pi + nRF24L01+ transceiver_.  

I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and make a positive impact in the world. On this profile, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my skills in software development and cybersecurity.  

I am particularly proud of two projects that I have completed recently:  
- [openSESAME](https://github.com/tTargiel/openSESAME-Password-Manager) - a cross-platform password manager written in C++ with a GUI created in QML. This project allows users to securely store their passwords and other sensitive information thanks to using AES256-ECB encryption.  
- [FinState](https://github.com/tTargiel/FinState-Budget-Manager) - budget manager created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project demonstrates my skills in full stack development and allows users to track and manage their personal finances.  

I have a wide range of interests and I enjoy combining them in my projects. I believe that this allows me to bring a unique perspective and approach to problem solving.  

In my free time, I take part in CTF competitions 🏴‍☠️ (under a name of _ducttape_ or casually _tTargiel_) with my university team called **saarsec**. I especially find learning about system security to be very exciting, as it requires deep knowledge of low-level design, assembly language, the ability to perform stack overflows, heap overflows, ROP-chaining and much more.  

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you find something of interest. 🙏  

> P.S. Almost forgot, I daily drive ✨ _Linux Mint_ ✨ since 2018 and Linux rocks!
