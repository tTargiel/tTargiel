### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋  

My name is Tomasz Targiel and I am Penetration Tester working with ISEC Sp. z o.o.

My background includes an Engineering degree in Applied Computer Science from the University of Wrocław and a one-year student exchange in Cybersecurity at Universität des Saarlandes. However, my education does not end there. Prior to these fields of study, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Socioeconomics, also at the University of Wrocław.  

I have written and successfully defended my Engineering Thesis 🔭 - __"Analysis of insufficient encryption of wireless keyboard communications: A case study"__, with practical example of both capturing and decrypting the transmission packets using: _self-made software + Raspberry Pi + nRF24L01+ transceiver_. If you are interested in software-part of my thesis, please have a look at: [nRF24L01-eavesdropping](https://github.com/tTargiel/nRF24L01-eavesdropping)  

I am particularly proud of the projects in software development, that I have completed:  
- [steganoCracker](https://github.com/tTargiel/steganoCracker) - steganography tool written in Python, with GUI in PyQt6 that is used for writing and reading hidden text to/from the least significant bits of image files. 
- [FinState](https://github.com/tTargiel/FinState-Budget-Manager) - budget manager created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project demonstrates my skills in full stack development and allows users to track and manage their personal finances.  
- [openSESAME](https://github.com/tTargiel/openSESAME-Password-Manager) - a cross-platform password manager written in C++ with a GUI created in QML. This project allows users to securely store their passwords and other sensitive information thanks to using AES256-ECB encryption.  

I have a wide range of interests and I enjoy combining them in my projects. I believe that this allows me to bring a unique perspective and approach to problem solving.  

In my free time, I take part in CTF competitions 🏴‍☠️ (under a name of _ducttape_ or casually _tTargiel_) with my university team called **saarsec**. I especially find learning about system security to be very exciting, as it requires deep knowledge of low-level design, assembly language, the ability to perform stack overflows, heap overflows, ROP-chaining and much more.  

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you find something of interest. 🙏  

> P.S. Almost forgot, I daily drive ✨ _Linux Mint_ ✨ since 2018 and Linux rocks!
